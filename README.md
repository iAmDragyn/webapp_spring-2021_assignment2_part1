**Learning objectives:** Our goal was to learn more about Vue.js and APIs by adding more functionality and features to our existing Google Book Search site from Classwork 3 on Javascript and Classwork on Vue.js. The main objectives were to add pagination for search results with next and previous buttons, refine the existing template for result display to list the authors correctly and not show undefined items. Some other features that were added in this version are thumbnails, main category/genre that the book belongs to, description, and price in USD. All of the above data fields were added from the JSON object of each book using Google Books API methods. <br>
<br>
**Technologies used:** HTML5, CSS3, Native Javascript, Vue.js for code, Visual Studio Code for development and testing, Google Chrome browser for testing, Windows 10 OS <br>
